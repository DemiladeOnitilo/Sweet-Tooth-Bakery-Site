            Sweet Tooth Bakery was born in the heart of Lagos from a passion for creating 
            <span className="text-pink-600 font-semibold"> irresistible cakes and pastries</span> 
            that bring joy to every celebration. Inspired by the warmth of Nigerian family 
            gatherings and the vibrant flavors of our culture, we craft treats that are as 
            beautiful as they are delicious.
            <br /><br />
            Our journey began with our founder‚Äôs grandmother, who baked for weddings, birthdays, 
            and Sunday afternoons, filling homes with the aroma of vanilla, coconut, and freshly 
            baked bread. Today, we carry forward her legacy, blending traditional recipes with 
            creative twists to surprise and delight our customers.
            <br /><br />
            Whether you‚Äôre celebrating a milestone or simply craving something sweet, Sweet Tooth 
            Bakery is here to make every bite a memory worth savoring.
